sub 005 awake has high emg power in A1, A2 channel which is why they were excluded
sub 006 anes has very high high frequency content in channel Fp2 -> not relevant within target region, no exclusion
sub 009 awake removed A1, A2 due to excessive high amplitude noise most probably due to high EMGsub 010 removed A1, A2 due to excessive high amplitude noise most probably due to high EMG
sub 010 awake, T1 shows higher emg noise but was not removed, maybe interpolation could be thought about
sub 011 awake, T3 shows high emg noise but was not removed, maybe interpolation could be thought about
