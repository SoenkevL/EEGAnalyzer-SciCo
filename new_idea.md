# New ideas and possible TODOs in the project

## Preprocessing
- keeping track of raw versions temporarily during the processing, optional
- creating a doc automatically that saves all created raw versions and figures suing the Report functionality

## Metric analysis
- multichannel metric calculation (I think I have it included somehow but was not optimal yet)

## GUI
- cropping
- raw version tracking
- Data information section not properly updating (e.g. when loading new file or doing preprocessing steps)
