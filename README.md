# EEGAnalyzer - Scientific Coworker

A comprehensive tool for analyzing EEG data with a focus on customizable metric analysis. Originally designed to analyze the
chaotic dynamics, complexity assessment, fractal-properties, and entropy of EEG signals for my Masters (https://essay.utwente.nl/104520/).  
The idea of this project is to bring together some of the most powerful python libraries for biomedical timeseries analysis. These
include mne for eeg processing, pandas to handle dataframes, neurokit2, and edge-of-py to provide the metrics for the analysis. 
However, the most important thing is that any library that you want to work with can be incorporated quickly and easily.

## Features

- **Analysis Capabilities**:
  - Custom python functions
  - Example includes:
    - Chaotic dynamics analysis
    - Complexity metrics evaluation
    - Fractal property detection
    - Entropy calculation methods

- **Modular Architecture**:
  - An example on GitHub showing the whole process you need to analyze your eegs. 
  - Extensible design for easily adding custom functions as metrics
  - Supports 1D and 2D timeseries data
  - Primarily written for EEG analysis while also providing functionality for other csv data in timeseries format.

- **Configuration**:
  - Adjustable parameters for analysis focused on timeseries.
  - Full folder (and subfolder) structures can be processed at once.
  - Ability to include only certain files based on a name
  - Full control over the output directories of the computed metrics
  - Parameters for epoching like start, stop, duration, and window overlap
  - Filtering
  - Integration with annotations of edf files to include only annotated data segments and exclude bad channels
  - Choosing predefined sets of metrics (python functions) to be applied to the data

- **Logging System**:
  - Track processing information for better debugging and monitoring

- **Output Format**:
  - Metrics saved in standardized CSV format
  - Additionally, creates a relational database allowing easy comparison of metrics with each other and the original eeg files
  - Provides a simple GUI to visualize the metrics and compare them to the original eeg files

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Vor visualizations:
  - QT
    - on ubuntu, see the following link: https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-linux
    - on arch, install using pacman: `sudo pacman -S qtcreator`
  - Tk
    - on ubuntu, install using apt: `sudo apt-get -y install tk`
    - on arch, install using pacman: `sudo pacman -S tk`

## Installation

We recommend installing the package within a virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### From PyPi
```bash
pip install eeganalyzer-scico
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoenkevL/EEGAnalyzer.git
cd EEGAnalyzer
```
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Using the Command-line Interface
Once installed as a package, you can use the command-line interface:

To analyze eegs:
```bash
eeganalyzer --yaml_config <path_to_config_file> --logfile_path <path_to_log_file>
```

Arguments:
- `--yaml_config`: Path to the YAML configuration file (required)
- `--logfile_path`: Path to the log file (optional)

and to visualize the metrics and compare them to the original eeg files:
```bash
eegviwer --sql_path <path_to_sqlite_database>
```
Arguments:
- `--sql_path`: Path to the SQLite database (required) 
## Using the Python API

You can also use the package as a Python library:

```python
from src.eeganalyzer.core.processor import process_experiment
from src.eeganalyzer.utils.config import load_yaml_file

# Load configuration
config = load_yaml_file('config.yaml')

# Process experiments
process_experiment(config, 'results/analysis.log')
```

## Example Analysis
### 1. Follow the installation instructions
Make sure you have installed the package as described above. If you decide you install the package via pip and not from
 source, please make sure you still clone the GitHub to have all example and preprocessing files at hand.

### 2. Prepare example data directory structure

```
mkdir -p example/eeg
```

### 3. Move a downloaded file to the correct location

Now we need to download an example eeg to test the pipeline on.
Any eeg file in fif format can be used.

For example, I recommend using the file PN00-1.edf from the following link.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekinnvonix/seina-scalp-epilepsy-dataset?resource=download (14.10.2024)  
The data comes from a platform called kaggle which provides open source data and code exchange for people interested
in the machine learning community. An account may be required to download the data but is completely without cost.
The downloaded file will be a zip, extract it to the root directory in which you currently are.
Additional edf files could be downloaded from the link. We focus only on using one in this example. \
After downloading the file, move it to the right folder with the following command
```
mv PN00-1.edf example/eeg/PN001-original.edf
```

### 4. Preprocessing the file (optional)

There are multiple possible approaches for Preprocessing the eeg in the folder *eeg_reading_and_preprocessing*.
1. Navigate to the folder and use the ipython notebook for an interactive experience
2. Use the *preprocess_and_inspect.py* file to inspect the data without relying on ipython notebooks
```
python3 eeg_reading_and_preprocessing/preprocess_and_inspect.py
```
3. Use the *preprocess_fast.py* to do the bare minimum preprocessing to execute the last step without any visual or textual outputs
```
python3 eeg_reading_and_preprocessing/preprocess_fast.py
```

For the following steps the original edf file will be used again and processed internally during the pipeline.
It is recommended, however, to preprocess the file manually beforehand to see what changes in filters, sampling frequency, and montage do to the EEG.

### 5. Inspecting the configuration and metrics file

Processing the eeg exactly how the user needs it is mainly defined by two files.
1. The config.yaml file: Here we set processing parameters like filters, montages, epoches, inclusion criteria, etc.
2. The metrics.py file: Here we set the metrics and import the libraries that we want to compute on our files.  
Both files have example versions in the example folder on our GitHub.

### 6. Run the main script with configuration

To calculate the metrics on our eeg files, we can run the example configuration using the following command.    
This will create the metrics and a log file, alternatively the command can be run without the logfile argument to see the output in the terminal.  
Make sure you are inside the project root with the virtual environment activated and the requirements installed.

```
    eeganalyzer \
    --yaml_config example/example_config_eeg.yaml \
    --logfile_path example/test.log
```

### 7. Analyzing the produced metrics

Now that we created two csv files and saved our data to our database, we can go ahead and do some analysis on it.
This can either be done in the GUI or in python.
For the gui simply run
```bash
eegviewer example/EEGAnalyzer.sqlite
```
In case you have problems with QT at this point and did not do preprocessing, please see the section above for possible fixes.

Alternatively, you can use python to do the analysis directly on the database or the computed csv files.
```
python3 example/metric_analysis_example.py
```
### 8. Summary

The provided example is intended as guidance to this pipeline. It can't show all the things that it can do, and now is the point
where you need to start experimenting with it yourself.

## Personal Note
To end on a personal note: In data analysis, it is hard to find a one-fits-all approach. On the one hand, the analysis of your data
should be a carefully pre-planned step of the final analysis. On the other hand, it can be exhilarating and interesting to
explore Data, its sampling parameters and different metrics to try understanding a part of the world from it.  
Data, and especially the way it is displayed, is very much subject to the experimenter and analyst.
Therefore, I want to remind anyone that you should not make your data fit your thesis but test your
thesis with your data by closely thinking about what you analyze and why.
